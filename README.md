# Swarm FS

Swarm FS is an upload layer on top of Bee that stamps chunks client-side and tracks which slots in a postage batch are occupied by each file. This makes it possible to "delete" a file by reclaiming its slots for future uploads — something Swarm has no native concept of.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --global swarm-fs
```

## Usage

Environment variables can be set in your shell profile for global use, or in a local `.env` file if you prefer per-project configuration:

```sh
export SWARMFS_UPLOAD_URL="http://localhost:1633/chunks"
export SWARMFS_SIGNER="<private key hex>"
export SWARMFS_BATCH_ID="<batch id hex>"
export SWARMFS_BATCH_DEPTH=<depth of your batch>
```

```sh
# Upload a file or directory and print the manifest root hash
swarm-fs upload <file|dir>

# Upload with client-side encryption
swarm-fs upload <file|dir> --encrypt

# List all tracked files and manifests
swarm-fs list

# Delete a file or manifest by root hash, reclaiming its slots
swarm-fs delete <root hash>

# Show slot usage and most utilized bucket
swarm-fs status

# Benchmark chunk splitting speed (no upload, no state changes)
swarm-fs bench:split <file|dir>

# Benchmark chunk splitting + stamp signing speed (no upload, no state changes)
# Requires SWARMFS_SIGNER, SWARMFS_BATCH_ID, and SWARMFS_BATCH_DEPTH
swarm-fs bench:sign <file|dir>
```

State is stored in `~/.swarmfs/`, with files named by the first 8 hex characters of the batch ID (e.g. `swarmfs-a1b2c3d4.free`, `swarmfs-a1b2c3d4.db`). Multiple postage batches can be used independently by switching `SWARMFS_BATCH_ID`.

## Design

Swarm FS stamps chunks client-side, which means it controls which `(bucket, slot)` each chunk is assigned to before sending the pre-signed chunk to the Bee API. This makes it possible to maintain a local index that tracks exactly which slots are occupied by each file, and to deliberately target previously freed slots when uploading new files.

All state lives under a `.swarmfs/` directory.

### `swarmfs.free` — SlotMap

A bitmap tracking slot occupancy across the entire batch. Each bit represents one slot: 0 = free, 1 = occupied. Pre-allocated at init time as all zeros, so the full batch capacity is available from the start.

```
per bucket (65536 entries, indexed by bucket number):
  [slot bitmap: slotsPerBucket / 8 bytes]
```

The fixed-size layout allows O(1) access by bucket index. Allocating a slot scans the bucket's bitmap for the first 0 bit and sets it to 1. Freeing a slot clears the corresponding bit. File size is determined by batch depth: for depth 24 (256 slots per bucket), the file is 2 MB.

### `swarmfs.db` — FileRegistry

A SQLite database tracking all uploaded files, their root chunk hash, and the slots they occupy.

```sql
CREATE TABLE files (
    id        INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    path      TEXT NOT NULL,
    root_hash BLOB NOT NULL,   -- 32 bytes
    chunks    BLOB NOT NULL,   -- repeated [bucket uint16, slot uint16] pairs
    kind      TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'file'  -- 'file' or 'manifest'
);
CREATE INDEX idx_root_hash ON files(root_hash);
```

Chunk refs are packed as 4 bytes each (`[bucket uint16][slot uint16]`), so overhead is approximately 4 bytes per chunk — about 0.1% of the file size — regardless of file size. The index on `root_hash` makes lookup and deletion O(log N) in the number of tracked files.

### Manifest upload flow

`upload <dir>` packages a directory as a Swarm website so it can be browsed via the Bzz gateway (`/bzz/<root-hash>/`).

It builds a [Mantaray v0.2](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee/tree/master/pkg/manifest/mantaray) trie — the same binary format Bee uses natively:

1. **Pass 1 — upload content**: walk the directory, split each file into chunks, stamp and upload each chunk, collect the root hash per file
2. **Pass 2 — build the trie**: construct a Mantaray node for every file path (no leading slash, e.g. `index.html`), plus a `'/'` metadata node carrying `website-index-document` if `index.html` is present — this is what Bee reads to serve the index page
3. **Upload the trie**: serialize each trie node into a chunk, stamp and upload it, record the manifest root hash in `swarmfs.db`

After upload, the directory is accessible at `<gateway>/bzz/<root-hash>/` and `<gateway>/bzz/<root-hash>/path/to/file`.

### Upload flow

1. Split the file into chunks client-side
2. For each chunk, allocate a slot from `swarmfs.free` for the matching bucket
3. Sign the stamp with the chosen `(bucket, slot)` and send the pre-signed chunk to Bee
4. Wrap the file in a single-entry Mantaray manifest (with a `website-index-document` pointer) so the file is directly browseable at `<gateway>/bzz/<root-hash>/`
5. Record the manifest root hash and all `(bucket, slot)` pairs in `swarmfs.db`

### Deletion flow

1. Look up the file's chunk list in `swarmfs.db`
2. Return all its `(bucket, slot)` pairs to `swarmfs.free` under their respective buckets
3. Remove the file entry from `swarmfs.db`
4. Optionally upload tombstone chunks to overwrite the slots on the network
